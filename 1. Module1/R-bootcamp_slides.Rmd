# What is R? <img src="./images/Rlogo.png" style="float: right;width: 7%"/>

Environment for statistical computing and graphics

--

Relatively simple **programming language**

.pull-left[
C is a compiled language
- Requires a complete program to run
- Fast
]

--

.pull-right[
R is an interpreted language
- Commands run interactively
- Flexible but slow
]

--

If C is faster, why use R?

- Over 10,000 Function Libraries
- Implements many common statistical procedures
- Exceptional graphics functions

---
# How does R compare to SAS/Stata? <img src="./images/Rlogo.png" style="float: right;width: 7%"/>

- Fairly similar committment for simple tasks (e.g., regression, EDA).

- Much better at plotting and visualizing data

- Much easier to use for complex tasks (e.g., advanced estimation, complex data)

- Overall, (much) greater ROI (IMO)

- For certain tasks (e.g., machine learning), the repertoire of tools available to R users is **unparalleled**.

Code completion / indentation / navigation

Package development / debugging

Project management / organization

Version control (git)

Creates HTML, Word, and pdf documents

A good option for reproducible research

# Running Code in R

To run a line of code in the R programming language, place your cursor at the end of a line, and press:

- COMMAND + RETURN (Mac)
- CTRL + ENTER (Windows)

```{r}
2*2*2
```

Alternatively, highlight a single or multiple lines with your cursor, and press the same keys

# R as a calculator

Most basically, R is a very advanced calculator:

```{r eval=T,warning=F,results='hide'}
2 + 2 # add numbers
2 * pi # multiply by a constant
3^4 # powers
runif(5) # random number generation
sqrt(4^2) # functions
log(10) # natural log (i.e., base e)
log(100, base = 10) # log base 10
23 %/% 2 # integer division
23 %% 2 # modulus operator

# scientific notation
5000000000 * 1000
5e9 * 1e3
```

More operators: [Quick-R](https://www.statmethods.net/management/operators.html)

# Assigning values to R objects 

R is "object oriented". A basic task in R is to assign values to objects and perform functions on them:

```{r}

a <- 10
a 
a/100
a+10

# R is case sensitive!!!
A <- 15
print(c(a,A))
```

---

# Vectors

```{r}
## Basic functional unit in R is a vector:
# numeric vector
nums <- c(1.1, 3, -5.7)
nums

nums <- rep(nums,2)
nums

# integer vector
ints <- c(1L, 5L, -3L) # force storage as integer not decimal number
# 'L' is for 'long integer' (historical)

# sample nums with replacement
new_nums <- sample(nums,8,replace = TRUE)
new_nums

```

---
# Vectors
```{r}
# logical (i.e., Boolean) vector
bools <- c(TRUE, FALSE, TRUE, FALSE, T, T, F, F)
bools
# character vector
chars <- c("epidemiology is", "the study", 
           "of the", "distribution", 
           "and determinants", "of disease", 
           "in", "a population")
chars
```

---
# Data Frames
Vectors can be combined into data frames (the basic data unit in R):
```{r}
A <- data.frame(new_nums,bools,chars)
A
```
---

# Lists
And pretty much anything (vectors, data frames) can be combined into lists:
```{r}
basic_list <- list(rep(1:3,5),
                   "what do you think of R so far?",
                   A)
basic_list[[1]]
basic_list[[2]]
head(basic_list[[3]])
```
---

# Subsetting
```{r}

vals <- seq(2, 12, by = 2)
vals

vals[3]
vals[3:5]
vals[c(1, 3, 6)];vals[-c(1, 3, 6)]
vals[c(rep(TRUE, 3), rep(FALSE, 2), TRUE)]

```

---

# Subsetting Data Frames

```{r error=T}
A[3,];A[,3]
A[2:3,];A[,2:3]
subset(A,bools==F,select = -bools)
```

# (Base) R Functions: Getting Help

```{r}
# HELP!
?median

help.search('linear regression')

help(package='ggplot2')

```
---

# (Base) R Functions: Object Structure

`iris` is a flower dataset included with R. The `str()` command gives the structure of the iris dataset:
```{r}
str(iris)
```

The `class()` command tells us what kind of object this is:
```{r}
class(iris)
```

# Using R & RStudio <img src="./images/RStudio-Logo-Gray.png" style="float: right;width: 25%"/>

R remains cutting edge through a network of users/maintainers who contribute **packages**. 
Packages are functions that are not part of base R.
Without these packages, R would be much less useful.

For example:

 - `VIM` is a package for the VIsualisation of Missing data

 - `boot` is a package to get bootstrap CIs and standard errors
 
 - `splines` is a package for including flexible regression splines in linear models
 
 - `data.table` is a package for fast manipulation of data frames

 - The `tidyverse` is a collection of packages that facilitate the practice of "tidy" data science.
---

# Installing and loading packages <img src="./images/tidyverse.png" style="float: right;width: 7%"/>

Let's install the tidyverse, and some other packages that are important for basic data visualization. 

If this is your first time installing packages in R, you'll have to choose a CRAN mirror. This is done with the "repos = " (repository) argument (but can be done other ways too).

```{r,warning=F,message=F}
install.packages("tidyverse",repos='http://lib.stat.cmu.edu/R/CRAN')
library(tidyverse)
```

You should get a warning and other messages that I excluded here.

---
# Installing and loading packages

Let's also install and load a package for the VIsualisation of Missing data:

```{r,warning=F,message=F}
 install.packages("VIM",repos='http://lib.stat.cmu.edu/R/CRAN')
 library(VIM)
```

---

# Importing data into R <img src="./images/readr.png" style="float: right;width: 7%"/>

We can now use functions from the `tidyverse` to load our NHEFS data:

```{r}
nhefs <- read_csv("./data/nhefs.csv")
```

---

# Importing data into R <img src="./images/readr.png" style="float: right;width: 7%"/>

Using the `tidyverse` package to import data (as opposed to base R options) creates a tibble, which is an augmented data frame.

```{r}
class(nhefs)
```

More options for importing data: [R Studio Data Import Cheat Sheet](https://github.com/rstudio/cheatsheets/raw/master/data-import.pdf)

---
# Exploring Data

Let's examine the structure of our NEHFS data:

```{r}
dim(nhefs)
```

There are `r nrow(nhefs)` observations, and `r ncol(nhefs)` columns in the nhefs tibble. 

--

Let's select only specific columns from this tibble. We can do this using functions in the `dplyr` package, which is part of the `tidyvverse`:

```{r}
nhefs <- nhefs %>% select(seqn,qsmk,sbp,dbp,sex,age,race,income,marital,school)
```

We'll learn more about the `%>%` (pipe) operator later. We've just re-written the nhefs object to include only the 10 variables in the `select()` function. 


---
# Exploring Data

This is what the selected columns look like:

```{r}
head(nhefs)
# can also use "tail" to see the end of the file
# tail(nhefs)
```

---

# Functions and for loops

Functions are pieces of code written to accomplish specific tasks. Suppose we wanted to evaluate the proportion of missing data in each column in `nhefs`. We could do this by writing a function:
```{r}
propMissing <- function(x){
  mean(is.na(x))
}
propMissing(nhefs[,1])
propMissing(nhefs[,2])
```
In the above code, `mean()` takes the sample average. In R, missing values are coded as `NA`, and `is.na()` is a base R function that returns a Boolean (true/false) value for each element in `x` that is missing. Thus, `mean(is.na(x))` returns the proportion of `x` that is missing.
---

# Functions and for loops

Instead of copying and pasting the function over and over, we can put it in a `for` loop:

```{r}
for (i in 1:10){
  output <- propMissing(nhefs[,i])
  print(output)
}
```
---

# Functions and for loops

Instead of a `for` loop, we can use the `apply` family of functions, which presents things in a way that is more informative. For example:
```{r}
apply(nhefs,2,propMissing)
```
More information on the apply family: [Apply tutorial](https://www.r-bloggers.com/r-tutorial-on-the-apply-family-of-functions/)

We can also make the above much more presentable and easier to read:
```{r}
round(apply(nhefs,2,propMissing),3)*100
```
